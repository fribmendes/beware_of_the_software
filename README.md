# Beware of the Software

I decided to do a screencast.

It's about uh… computer stuff, let’s call it that.

For now it's about distributed systems in Elixir. I can't promise this will be
the same, always. Afterwards I'm thinking about going through some CS papers.
Or something better. If you have some suggestions, I'm completely open to hear
them.
